A common situation is when you want to separate one spatial data Table into multiple Tables depending on the values ​​of a Field from the original Table_

<!--more-->

This may occur, for example, if you need to **generate multiple Tables from a Table of buildings** according to their category or type. Spatial Manager Desktop™ allows you to easily **separate a Layer in a Map into other Layers** by selecting the Field that defines the separate rule and other options of interest.

This video shows this process by **creating new Tables in ESRI Shape (SHP) files** and also creating a <a title="Google Earth website" href="http://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Earth</a> **KML file** including different folders, in both cases from some of the different categories of buildings in the original Table.
