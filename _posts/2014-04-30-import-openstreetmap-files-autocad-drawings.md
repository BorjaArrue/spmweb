Many AutoCAD users, such as architects, surveyors, engineers, etc., often need access to territorial information as a basis for their own projects or their work related in some way to the territory <!--more-->

<a title="OpenStreetMap main website" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> community has this kind of spatial information, which is freely available, supported by thousands of users worldwide and continuously updated (see the previous post in this Blog)

Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD includes, as other products in the Spatial Manager™ suite, its own data provider to access the information **in OpenStreetMap and import it as graphical objects and alphanumeric data** (EED)

In this example, by using the search and navigation tools in the main <a title="OpenStreetMap main website" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> website, we locate the spatial information relating to a given city and the search process is focused on a specific area of the city. Then, from this website, the information is exported to an OSM file which will be used in Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD to import OpenStreetMap data into an <a title="AutoCAD web page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> drawing

The information to be imported into <a title="AutoCAD web page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> from the OSM file is segmented. First, the buildings are imported and automatically separated into different <a title="AutoCAD web page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> layers, according to their build type. Then, the routes are imported into another Layer

Also, we configure the application to perform a **Coordinate Transformation** to project the objects over the import process (<a title="OpenStreetMap main website" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OpenStreetMap</a> information is defined using the <a title="World Geodetic System" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGS_84" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WGS 84 </a>Latitude-Longitude system &#8211; <a title="EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset" href="http://www.epsg-registry.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">EPSG</a>: 4326)
