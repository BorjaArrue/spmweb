<p>
  One of the most used techniques to load data tables from spatial files into a Spatial Manager Desktop™ Map is through dragging and dropping them from Windows explorer <!--more-->
</p>

<p>
  <strong>This way of loading is very fast and allows you to load several files at one time</strong>, as long as these kind of files do not need additional parameters to load them (for example, loading Shapefiles). If the data Provider used for the files to load needs additional parameters, it is only possible to drag and drop one file each time (for example, loading KML files)
</p>

<p>
  Also, it is possible <strong>to assign Spatial Manager Desktop™ as the application to &#8220;Open&#8221; a file</strong> type in Windows explorer and, in this way, to load directly this type of file into a new Map, by using a double-click or though the contextual menu in Windows explorer
