The Spatial Manager Desktop™ &#8220;Properties&#8221; panel and the &#8220;Properties&#8221; area inside the Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD &#8220;SpatialManager&#8221; palette, present, in a concise and practical format, all the relevant information about the different parts of the applications, and allow you to review their content and features<!--more-->

In Spatial Manager Desktop™, you will find there information about Data sources (Folders, Files, Shortcuts, UDSs, Databases and Stores, Schemas, Tables &#8211; Feature classes, etc.), Layers, Maps, Selected Features, Tasks and Tasks sources or targets

It is important to **understand how to change the focus in the application** to see the data you want to. While it may sound obvious, there are cases in which this change of  focus is not so evident. For example, if you have selected a Layer on the ribbon &#8220;Layers&#8221;, you will see all the information about the Layer in the &#8220;Properties&#8221; panel; now, if you select all Features in the Layer, using the corresponding function on the same ribbon , you will notice no change in the &#8220;Properties&#8221; panel, which will continue to provide information about the Layer, and you will **need to change the focus in the application to the Map Workspace**, by clicking on its tab, so that the &#8220;Properties&#8221; panel presents information about the Selected Features

The following video shows various &#8220;Properties&#8221; panel display cases and some ways to change the focus in the application:



In Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD, you will also find information about Data sources (Folders, Files, Shortcuts, UDSs, Databases and Stores, Schemas, Tables &#8211; Feature classes, etc.), and about Selected Objects. The information showed in the latter case is extremely important because, in addition to some basic geometric information about the objects, you will find here the imported data from incoming Tables that has been stored as Extended Entity Data (EED or XDATA) in AutoCAD

The following video shows various &#8220;Properties&#8221; area display cases in the &#8220;SpatialManager&#8221; palette, including EEDs resulting in the imported Objects:
