Scenario #2: We receive a set of spatial data including parcels (inside a Shapefile-SHP) and some hydrants (inside a KML file) belonging to a city. We need to generate a KML file which includes the parcels that have no assigned street name (&#8220;Not_assigned&#8221;) and the hydrants located within these parcels, to send it to another user who will open the KML file in Google Earth (Time spent: 3 min.)

Spatial Manager™ software is not designed to compete with most of the existing GIS applications on the market. It really is a complementary tool for managing spatial data quickly, easily and inexpensively. Therefore, many users, including GIS applications users, consider it extremely practical and they use it on a daily basis

Despite the powerful tools included in traditional GIS applications (<a title="ESRI ArcGIS page" href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ArcGIS</a> and others), professionals using spatial data on their projects, maps or any task related to the territory, constantly **need to check, extract, simplify or transfer** their spatial data to other users

If you still do not use <a title="Spatial Manager web" href="/">Spatial Manager™</a>, discover a top quality and easy to use software. See how many processes which are necessary in the daily management of your spatial information, can be carried out by the functionality included in the application in a flexible and practical way:

_<span>Scenario #2</span>: We receive a set of spatial data including parcels (inside a <a title="Shapefiles (SHP) wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shapefile-SHP</a>) and some hydrants (inside a <a title="KML file wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KML</a> file) belonging to a city. We need to generate a <a title="KML file wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KML</a> file which includes the parcels that have no assigned street name (&#8220;Not_assigned&#8221;) and the hydrants located within these parcels, to send it to another user who will open the <a title="KML file wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KML</a> file in <a title="Google Earth page" href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Earth</a>_

_The easy steps to follow are:_

_1 &#8211; We load both files by dragging them from Windows explorer into a Map of the city (or into an empty Map)
  
_ _2 &#8211; We search the unassigned parcels by performing a selection query. We export the queried Features to a folder inside a new <a title="KML file wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KML</a> file (by transforming the coordinates)
  
_ _3 &#8211; We locate the hydrants within the previous parcels by performing a spatial query. We export the queried features to a new folder into the same <a title="KML file wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">KML</a> file

When we have finished, we can check the resulting file by opening it in <a title="Google Earth page" href="https://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Earth</a>_
