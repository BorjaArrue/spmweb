Using base maps (roads, aerial, etc.) from imagery providers allows, not only the composition of more attractive Maps in mapping applications, but also the use of these base images as a practical reference system or a powerful tool for checking on the Maps<!--more-->

All functions relating to viewing, printing or copying Maps, consider the configured background for a correct representation of these Maps

In the following example, we will use some <a title="Bing Maps" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Maps" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bing maps</a>, integrated into the application, as Map backgrounds in a sample Map, and, in addition to the changes between the base maps, you will see how the image grids are re-calculated according to the different scales of the Map
