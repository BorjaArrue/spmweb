While in the early beta versions of Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD the FDO Providers were not included in the standard data Providers list, finally they have been added to this list<!--more-->

Using these new data Providers, Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD will also **import Features from SDF files, MySQL databases and more, as <a title="Autodesk" href="http://www.autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> Objects**, including their data tables as Extended Entity Data (EED or XDATA) for these objects

These data Providers are integrated in the application as any other standard data Provider included previously, allowing the user to import Objects in AutoCAD directly from most types of spatial files or to define more types of User Data Sources (UDS) to access spatial databases or spatial data stores
