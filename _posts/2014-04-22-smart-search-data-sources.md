When working with external Layers, which are loaded into a Map by reading spatial data sources, one of the usual problems is the modification (change of name, change of location, etc.) of these data sources<!--more-->

Spatial Manager Desktop™ includes a smart search technology to find missing data sources. Using this technology, the user enters a minimum amount of information when a set of data sources goes through the same type of change

For example, if a set of spatial files, which includes the information of the external Layers of a Map, is moved to another folder, the user just needs to enter the new location of one of these files and Spatial Manager Desktop™ will try to find the remaining files in the same location. Other examples could be the edition of a Shortcut, modifying a User Data Source (UDS), etc.

In the example shown in this video, a Map is composed and saved using some external Layers from <a title="Shapefiles Wiki" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefiles" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shapefiles (SHP files)</a>, which are then moved to another folder. Notice how this technology works, **by locating spatial files and what information is provided to the user** once the complete Map loading operation is performed
