The diverse sources of global spatial data available nowadays provide extensive opportunities to get territorial information, which can complement generic drawings or maps. One such source is Google Earth<!--more-->

Many planners and other map makers need to add specific information to their spatial layouts in order to complete projects, plans or maps. Within <a title="Google Earth page" href="http://www.google.com/earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google Earth</a> it is possible to locate a large amount of this type of information, which can be incorporated into the cartography generated and maintained using CAD ​​applications such as <a title="AutoCAD page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a>

The **Google Earth KML/KMZ provider included in Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD**, and the built-in functionality of the application itself, allow you to carry out these tasks easily and quickly

In this example, over the map of a city drawn in <a title="AutoCAD page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> (Milan), we need to add locator objects pointing to the main hospitals in the city. We use a **little known Google Earth tool** which allows us to save a KML file including the cartographic features located through a specific search

To represent these locators inside the <a title="AutoCAD page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> drawing, a simple <a title="AutoCAD page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a> Block will be used. The Block definition incorporates an Attribute for the name of the hospitals
