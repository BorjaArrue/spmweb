Ever more basic AutoCAD users, working in sectors such as architecture, engineering, or landscaping,, need access to spatial data as a base or complement to their own designs and projects<!--more-->

Often such data is housed in corporate spatial data servers. Most applications which enable you to import spatial data in <a title="AutoCAD product page" href="http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">AutoCAD</a>, only allow you to import this data from files**,** but do not provide you with access to spatial data servers

Spatial Manager™ for AutoCAD includes this functionality, applying the same ease of use that can be seen when importing spatial data from files. Its **exclusive data providers** and the application design itself, in which the development layers of the data providers are separate from the application, allow you to connect, access and import spatial data from <a title="PostGIS Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PostGIS</a> servers, <a title="MS SQL Server product page" href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MS SQL Server Spatial </a>servers, <a title="WFS Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WFS</a> data stores and many others, which are currently under development

In this example, you can analyze how to **access a PostGIS server**, and their <a title="Schema Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">schemas</a>, and to import data from various tables of a schema, using the same import options as if it were imported from spatial files
