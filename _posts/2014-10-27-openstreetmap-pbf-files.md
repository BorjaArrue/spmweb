The OpenStreetMap data provider in Spatial Manager now supports PBF files. The <a title="PBF OpenStreepMap Wiki page" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PBF</a> Format (Protocolbuffer Binary Format) is primarily intended as an alternative to the XML format. It is about half of the size of an OSM gzipped file. It is also about 6x faster to read. The format was designed to support future extensibility and flexibility in OpenStreetMap

You can now import spatial data in AutoCAD from OpenStreetMap **up to 20 times faster**
