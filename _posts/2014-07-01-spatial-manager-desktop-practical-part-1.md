Scenario #1: We need to quickly check which the appropriate file is, between three Shapefiles (SHP) files that include the same data but whose spatial geometric information is different (Time spent: 60 s.)

Spatial Manager™ software is not designed to compete with most of the existing GIS applications on the market. It really is a complementary tool for managing spatial data quickly, easily and inexpensively. Therefore, many users, including GIS applications users, consider it extremely practical and they use it on a daily basis (Part 1)

Despite the powerful tools included in traditional GIS applications (<a title="ESRI ArcGIS page" href="http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ArcGIS</a> and others), professionals using spatial data on their projects, maps or any task related to the territory, constantly **need to check, extract, simplify or transfer** their spatial data to other users

If you still do not use <a title="Spatial Manager web" href="http://www.spatialmanager.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Spatial Manager™</a>, discover a top quality and easy to use software. See how many processes which are necessary in the daily management of your spatial information, can be carried out by the functionality included in the application in a flexible and practical way:

_<span>Scenario #1</span>: We need to quickly check which the appropriate file is, between three <a title="Shapefiles (SHP) wiki" href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shapefiles (SHP)</a> files that include the same data but whose spatial geometric information is different_

_We will take advantage of the option to drag files from Windows Explorer into a Map, the simple styling systems to difference Layers of information and the option to display a background map, which allows us to compare the location of the three layers_
