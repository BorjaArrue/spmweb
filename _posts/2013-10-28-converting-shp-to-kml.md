Google Earth has become one of the most popular systems for viewing and querying spatial information, not only for of its ease of use but also because of the quality and quantity of information layers provided by the system itself<!--more-->

Spatial Manager Desktopâ„¢ allows you to perform quick, simple conversions of the information contained in spatial files or databases **to new or existing KML or KMZ files** using all the possibilities offered by the data structure of these files, **such as a folder structure** or automatic creation of labels for the converted Features.

This video shows how to convert from complete ESRI Shapefiles (SHP) or queried information within SHP files, in both cases belonging to a municipality, to a KML file, using a simple structure of folders and descriptive information labels for the Features in the target file.
