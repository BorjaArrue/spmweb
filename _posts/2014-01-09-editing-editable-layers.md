&#8216;Non editable&#8217; Layers are those that are connected to any data source through a &#8216;read only&#8217; data Provider<!--more-->

The reason why these layers are deemed &#8216;non-editable&#8217; is that, since **the data sources connected can not be saved** if their content in a Map is changed, the application prevents you from deleting Features or modifying data in the Data grid or editing their Fields

To carry out any of these editing operations on a &#8216;non editable&#8217; Layer, for example deleting some of its Features, **we need to &#8216;Disconnect&#8217; the Layer from its data source**, so that its content will be stored in the Map and will become an &#8216;editable&#8217; Layer

You cannot undo this operation so you should avoid saving the original Map. It is recommended to save the modified Map using another name or into another location
