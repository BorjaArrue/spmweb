## Ordnance Survey: Britain&#8217;s mapping agency

Ordnance Survey has moved from simply being the producer of the world-famous paper maps to producing **quality digital map data**, online route planning and sharing services, plus many other location-based products for the United Kingdom users

Its geographic data is so vast, yet at the same time so granular and accurate, that they have mapped **the location of every fixed physical object in Great Britain**, from the ground upwards, to within an accuracy of one meter. In addition, they have a team of around 300 surveyors and two aircraft that produce 10,000 updates to its system a day – to their <a href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/products/mastermap-products.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">OS MasterMap</a> database

This awesome application includes a powerful GML data provider that has several import parameters and options designed to consider the possiibilities of the huge vector data model that a technical user can get from the main OS vector product: OS MasterMap

On the other hand, <a href="http://www.spatialmanager.com/spm-forbricscad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8216;Spatial Manager for BricsCAD&#8217;</a> also brings to the user a powerful and easy to use **Background Maps technology and access to the Ordnance Survey Image maps** products. This functionality automatically selects the &#8216;Background Map images&#8217; (tiles) to download and display depending on the drawing view. The &#8217;tiles&#8217; are automatically updated when the view is modified by zooms, pans, etc.

The use of the OS image maps with <a href="http://www.spatialmanager.com/spm-forbricscad/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&#8216;Spatial Manager for BricsCAD&#8217;</a> allows the technicians to not only get more attractive drawings but also to provide them with an unmatched tool for checking, geo-spatial comparisons, etc.
